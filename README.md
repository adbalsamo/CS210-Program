# CS210-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to create a list of four menu options. Options 1, 2, and 3 opened and read a .txt file with a list of grocery items. Option 1 was to prompt a user for input then return a numeric value for the frequency of that item. Option 2 was to print a list of the grocery items with the number of times that item appeared in the .txt file. Option 3 was the same as Option 2, but instead of the numeric value, a histogram was printed. Option 4 was simply to quit the program. A local grocery store needed to track their produce items sold in a given day so they can rearrange the layout and increase sales. This program helped track the items that were sold to help with the rearrangement of the store.

#What did you do particularly well?
I found that I was able to create input validation in such a way that no matter what the user entered, there was a way for the program to run and give accurate information. This was something I did not do well in previous projects, but I felt I had a good sense of how to do it for this project. This was helpful in making sure the program did not crash or give incorrect data.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I can enhance my code by spending more time considering how the code should be organized. For example, I created a separate class for each menu option (except for option 4 - to quit) to keep the code clean and organized, but also to reinforce what we learned about classes. I think this worked out, but for such a small program, I don't think it was worth having that many classes. If I do stick with separate classes, I think it can be beneficial to use inheritence to make the code simpler and cleaner. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found that the structure of the code, specifically the classes, was the most challenging. I've struggled with when and where to structure them as well as naming conventions for constructors, classes, and methods. I'm still working on solidifying this information. Using drop-in tutoring through school has been a great resource. YouTube and Google have been incredibly helpful as well. Using ChatGPT to ask, "what is this code doing?" to reinforce those steps was helpful as well. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
In short, everything! Reinforcing basics like loops, user input, input validation, and reading and writing files can be helpful for other projects. I think simply seeing how projects come together from start to finish (even if smaller projects) can show how to organize code and how different parts of the process come together. It's one thing to write one for-loop for a participating activity, but it's another thing to have that for-loop run alongside all the other code that makes up a program without errors. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using separate classes helped keep the code organized which helps with readability. Including comments (maybe too many comments), would help if another developer had to access and update/adjust my code. Keeping the main source file clean and minimal helps too.
